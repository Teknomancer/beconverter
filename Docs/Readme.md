# BeConverter

BeConverter is a units of measure conversion utility for the Haiku operating system.
BeConverter does not work on Windows, GNU/Linux or MacOS.

BeConverter is open source and published under the BSD 3-clause license.
BeConveter was originally written by Ramshankar (Teknomancer) for BeOS.
He open sourced it in 1 January 2016.
Work on the Haiku port began in 29 December 2023 by OscarL.
Hopefully the port comes to fruition and it will be developed/maintained by the two of them in their spare time.
BeConverter is currently only developed/maintained for Haiku.
The final version available for BeOS is 1.2 with no further updates planned.

Extra credits for the original BeOS port:

Programming: Ramshankar ("Somebody" on BeShare, aka Teknomancer)
