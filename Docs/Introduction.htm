<H2>Introduction</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Thank you for using the BeConverter...</P>

<P>If you are one of those who installed the BeConverter and played around a bit then skip this section&mdash;it wasn't meant for you. For those who actually read this introduction before trying it, I would like to thank you for making all the trouble of writing this introduction worthwhile. If you haven't actually tried the BeConverter then you might want to do so after reading this introduction, then you may agree that the BeConverter isn't your everyday Dollar to Swiss Francs converter ;)</P>

<P>The BeConverter is a one-of-a-kind, BeOS native, multi-threaded conversion tool. It supports high-speed, "live" cross-unit conversions using a custom built conversion engine. Another handy feature of the BeConverter is that it makes use of BeOS' 64-bit journaling file system which improves its customizability, speed and size factor. It was written with speed and stability in mind, while not compromising on convienience and customizability. All in all, the BeConverter is a robust, fast, compact, stable, graphical conversion utility.</P>

<P>This version of the BeConverter features over 30 categories of data equivalents including Distance, Time, Money, Volume, Coverage, Area, Mass and many more. Under each category you can convert to and from several related units. This version features totally over 350 units! All of which you can use in an easy to use graphical user interface.</P>

<P>Using the BeConverter is very simply and someone totally new to BeOS could use it well without any difficulties. For detailed, step-by-step information on how to use the BeConverter read the "Using BeConverter" section of this manual.</P>

<P>The possibilities where you can make use of a converter are plenty. Another big convienience is that all the units are calculates "live", which means all the units are recalculated as you type.</P>

<P>Apart from this, you can also create your own categories with your own units, or modify existing categories to support new units. Read the "Custom categories" section for more information on how to do this.</P>
