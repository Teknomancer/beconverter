<H3>Installing BeConverter</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
BeConverter is distributed in a SoftwareValet package file. Just locate the file <FONT COLOR=#008D39><TT>BeConverter.pkg</TT></FONT> and double click it. Now BeConverter's installer will begin. Follow the instructions on screen and complete the installation.<BR><BR>

If you wish to move BeConverter to another location, all of its application and data files are self-contained in the BeConverter folder. You are welcome to move the <FONT COLOR=#008D39><TT>BeConverter</TT></FONT> folder to any BeOS File System as long as you keep the data files within it.<BR><BR>

<B><FONT FACE=Helvetica COLOR=#DC0000>Important note</FONT></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
No matter to which folder you install or move BeConverter, that folder <B>must</B> be inside a BeOS File System (BFS volume). This is because the critical data files that accompany BeConverter need specific features of BFS.<BR><BR>
Hence you <B>cannot</B> install BeConverter to a FAT16 or FAT32 partition.
