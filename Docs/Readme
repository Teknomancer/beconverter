[ Intro ]
		"Intros are a real bore"
			-- Documentation Crew

BeConverter is a BeOS native, multi-threaded unit of measure conversion
tool. It features high-speed, "live" cross-unit conversions using a custom
built conversion engine. BeConverter will come in handy for American
citizens since USA is the only country not to follow the metric system.
For e.g: the US follows farenheit instead of celcius as a measure of
temperature and miles instead of kilometers etc.

BeConverter is a freeware program and can be used, copied and
distributed freely but only in accord to the license agreement. A
similar app for Windows is being sold for $25 (USD) :-( So the least
you could do is write to me about BeConverter and copy it totally
in accord to the License.

BeConverter is completely extensible and flexible. It uses features of
the BeOS File System (BFS) to its advantage for speed and ease of
handling, the main reason why the BFS approach was chosen was not
only will it bring in complete customizability but because I was lazy to
write a new window for editing and adding units, checking for validity
etc. :^)

			-- Ask anyone but your grandparents

Version 1.2
* Added one new category: Euro
* Changed colors for the main list. Selected item is more clear now.
* Cleaned up some code, resulting in 4 KB reduction of binary! :)
* Optimized factor-based conversion routine marginally.

[ How to use BeConverter ]
		"eaaagh... One must know how thu use ... eaagghhh... sthuff"
			-- Sly Eastennegar

*	Just fire up BeConverter by double clicking its icon. The first
	window you will see on screen is a window that lists the available
	categories. A category is a collection of related units, e.g.
	Velocity, Volume, Time etc.

*	Choose the category you require and double click it, or press
	<ENTER>, or click the "Converter..." button.

*	Now this will open up the Converter window through which you
	can perform the conversion across the various units available in
	the category.

The option button that is selected in the converter window is the base
unit in which you must enter the quantity. As you type in the quantity,
the corresponding quantity in all the other units will be shown.

The control with a ".#" indicates the current decimal precision of the
result and can be changed, e.g. when the number is 4.334 and the
precision is changed to 2, the number becomes 4.33.

The ".# e" checkbox lets you specify if the result is to be shown in
scientific mode, for e.g., in scientific mode 40000 is shown as 4e+4. The
scientific precision for exponential notation is dependent on the precision
setting. The "Copy" button copies the current conversion to the clipboard
for use with other applications.

In the text area where you type in the quantity a mathematical
expression can be typed, e.g. (2 * 3) - (3 * 1) would return the value
as 3.

This is the basics of using BeConverter for converting units. BeConverter
also supports custom units. Open the "Units" folder and take a look at
the units in "Temperature" and "Velocity". Both these categories have
different kinds of units that BeConverter can recognize.

BeConverter displays only the first 23 units in any category. This issue
may be fixed soon, but no one complained :) so ...



[ Extra tweaking ]
		"A software without tweakability is no software at all"
			-- Anonymous

BeConverter, since totally customizable makes it easy to add, edit,
delete, rename units and categories. All categories are folders and
all units are files in the folder (with the mime type: text/x-BeConverter
or text/x-BeConverterFormula). To tweak the units of a category,
open the category folder and change to "List View" in Tracker. Now
you will be able to see the files with their attributes (if not choose the
extra attributes from the Attributes menu of the Tracker window).

* Revealing extra units:
Some of the categories have more than 23 units but due to lack of
space in the Converter window, BeConverter displays only the first
23 units in the category. Sometimes, if the unit is common and you
can't find that unit displayed through BeConverter, then go to the
folder where those units are stored and most probably you may find
more units. To make these units available to BeConverter rename the 
file in such a way it moves up (like adding a space before the file name).

* Removing unwanted units
You can remove unwanted units by bouncing them off the list, if there
are more than 23 units. You can do this by renaming the file in such a
way it moves to the bottom (like adding a 'z' before the file name). If
you have less than 23 units you might as well keep them all because
you will be able to use all of them.

* Adjust unit positions
Adjusting the position of units is a bit tricky. While its easy to move a
unit right to the top or bottom moving it to a precise location is not. The
best and most effective method is renaming the file name in such a way
it moves itself to the required location. By explaining it with an example
you may be able to understand better. Suppose there are 4 units 001,
002, 003 and 004 and you want to move 003 before 001 then rename
the file 003 as 0011. Suppose you want to move 004 after 002 then
rename 004 as 0021 and so on. This is because Tracker sorts the
filenames as strings and not as numbers. This is the reason why we
name the units as 001 and not as 1. If we name them like 1, 2, 3 and
so on then once 10 comes it will be sorted after 1. So we will have
1, 10, 2, 3 ... 9 and so on, hence we use two zeros before to ensure
proper sorting.



[ Contact info ]
		"Thats not a bug... its a hidden feature!"
			-- Hope not!

BeConverter is an on-going effort and I need your feedback and
encouragement to keep me interested in such projects. Anyway, I'm
looking forward for your feedback, and I'm ready to answer any
questions and I'm always open to suggestions and positive criticism and
I wouldn't mind a few praises now and then either :)

I can be contacted through e-mail: ramshankar@bemail.org

[ Known problems and limitations ]
		"S.O.S -- Save our software..."
			-- /me

Well, this is the TODO section of BeConverter at the moment...

* Precision menu's back picture doesn't redraw after selecting precision
	This could probably be a bug in the OS (when the menu has back-pic)
* Binary subtraction operator has a few minor glitches, needs fixing
* Improve the speed of loading categories (by eliminating the temp file?)



[ Credits ]
		"Just don't forget my part in all this ..."
			-- Whats his name?

Programming:	Ramshankar (Somebody)
Encouragement:	Ablyss (of BeShare) :-)

Thanks to Marco Nelissen for his help with the BMimeType class...

Also thanks to all the people who sent me mail saying they would have 
bought BeConverter even if it costs something from 25 to even 50
dollars!! Yes I got quite a few mails saying that or something much to
that effect. Thanks all. This helps me sustain my efforts to make more
commercial quality apps for BeOS... Thanks.
