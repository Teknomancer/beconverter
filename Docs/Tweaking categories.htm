<H2>Tweaking categories</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This section teaches you how to alter the default categories to suit your needs.</P>
<H3>Revealing Extra units</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Some of the categories have more than 23 units but due to lack of space in the Converter window, BeConverter displays only the first 23 units in the category. Sometimes, if the unit is common and you can't find that unit displayed through BeConverter, then go to the folder where those units are stored and most probably you may find more units. To make these units available to BeConverter rename the file in such a way it moves up (like adding a space before the file name).</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Removing unwanted units</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You can remove unwanted units by bouncing them off the list, if there are more than 23 units. You can do this by renaming the file in such a way it moves to the bottom (like adding a 'z' before the file name). If you have less than 23 units you might as well keep them all because you will be able to use all of them.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Adjust unit positions</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Adjusting the position of units is a bit tricky. While its easy to move a unit right to the top or bottom moving it to a precise location is not. The best and most effective method is renaming the file name in such a way it moves itself to the required location. By explaining it with an example you may be able to understand better. Suppose there are 4 units 001, 002, 003 and 004 and you want to move 003 before 001 then rename the file 003 as 0011. Suppose you want to move 004 after 002 then rename 004 as 0021 and so on.<BR><BR>

This is because <I><FONT FACE=Helvetica COLOR=991122>Tracker</FONT></I> sorts the file names as strings and not as numbers. This is the reason why we name the units as 001 and not as 1. If we name them like 1, 2, 3 and so on then once 10 comes it will be sorted after 1. So we will have 1, 10, 2, 3 ... 9 and so on, hence we use two zeros before to ensure proper sorting.
