<H2>Setting options</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The BeConverter's Option window looks like this:</P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/OptionsWindow.png" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"></CENTER>
<P>The <B><FONT FACE=Helvetica COLOR=#550088>Precision</FONT></B> textbox is where you specify the default precision (number of decimal places) used by the converter. Everytime you open a new Converter window, this precision is used. The precision can range from 0 to 100 and must an integral value.</P>

<P>The <B><FONT FACE=Helvetica COLOR=#550088>Use scientific notation</FONT></B> checkbox is where you specify whether or not you want the converter to display values in scientific notation. In our illustration the scientific notation is turned on, which means values in the Converter window will be displayed in scientific notation by default. Here again, whenever you open a new Converter window this option will be used.</P>

<P>In scientific notation mode, very large or very small values are expressed as powers of 10. For example, in scientific notation 999e+3 means 999 &times; 10&sup3;.</P>

<P>The <B><FONT FACE=Helvetica COLOR=#550088>Use radian values...</FONT></B> checkbox is where you specify whether or not you want trigonometric functions in expressions to use radians. In our illustration its checked off which means trigonometric functions will use degree values.</P>

<P>The <B><FONT FACE=Helvetica COLOR=#550088>Register Mime types...</FONT></B> checkbox lets you specify whether or not you want BeConverter to register its file-types everytime it starts-up. I won't get too technical, but remember that this option can safely be unchecked once BeConverter has registered its file-types on your system.</P>

<P>If you transfer BeConverter to a new system, then the first time you use it, this option will be turned on (unless you transfer the settings files too) and from then on you can un-check it.</P>

<P>The <B><FONT FACE=Helvetica COLOR=#550088>OK</FONT></B> button saves any changes you have made to the settings and closes the Options window. Please note that the settings will <I>not</I> take effect for Converter windows already open. Newly launched Converter windows will begin with these settings.</P>

<P>The <B><FONT FACE=Helvetica COLOR=#550088>Cancel</FONT></B> button discards any changes you have made since you opened the Options window, and closes the Options window.</P>

<P>These options are all default options, which means that until you change these options again, BeConverter will remember and use them. The 'precision' and 'notation' options are also available in each Converter window, but when you alter them there they are not saved. Those options are only temporary while the options here are not.</P>
